## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Image Deblurring System. It is intended for use by the development team, project stakeholders, and quality assurance team. This document will serve as the foundation for the software development process and as a reference for validation testing.

### 1.2 Scope

The Image Deblurring System consists of two main components:

1. **Deep Learning Model**: A sophisticated neural network model based on PyTorch that removes blur from images using a dense field architecture with multiple dilation factors.

2. **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web application that allows users to upload blurred images, process them through the deblurring model, and download the restored results.

The system will provide an accessible solution for users to restore clarity to blurred images without requiring technical expertise or specialized software. This application will benefit individuals with personal photos affected by motion blur, focus issues, or other blurring artifacts, as well as professionals who need to recover visual information from technically compromised images.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The Image Deblurring System will provide the following key functions:

1. **User Authentication (Optional)**: The system shall provide optional user registration and login functionality to save processing history. For users who prefer not to register, anonymous usage will be supported with full access to core deblurring features.

2. **Image Upload**: The system shall accept common image formats including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP. It will validate image size and content upon upload and provide immediate feedback on upload success or failure.

3. **Image Preprocessing**: The system shall automatically analyze image characteristics and normalize input images to prepare them for the deblurring model. This preprocessing will be transparent to the user but essential for optimal model performance.

4. **Deblurring Process**: The system shall process images through the dense field neural network with appropriate dilation factors. It will optimize output quality through post-processing and provide status updates during the deblurring operation.

5. **Result Management**: The system shall display before/after comparison of the original and deblurred images. Users will be able to download the deblurred images and view image quality metrics if desired.

6. **History and Batch Processing**: For registered users, the system shall store processing history and allow batch processing of multiple images in a single operation.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

The system targets two primary user groups:

1. **General Users**: This group consists of individuals with limited technical expertise in image processing who have an occasional need for image deblurring services. They primarily work with personal photographs and may access the system from various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
