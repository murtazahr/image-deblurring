# Software Project Plan

## 1. OVERVIEW

This project aims to develop an Image Deblurring System that combines advanced deep learning technology with a user-friendly web interface. The motivation for this project is to address the widespread problem of image blur, which affects both casual photographers and professionals who need to recover visual information from blurred images.

The system will consist of two main components:
1. A deep learning model based on a dense field neural network architecture with multiple dilation factors (as specified in the provided PyTorch code)
2. A web-based user interface that allows users to upload, process, and download deblurred images

The project will be executed by a team of two student developers over a period of 4.5 months. The system will be designed to be accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise, making sophisticated deblurring technology available to everyday users without requiring specialized knowledge or software.

The primary users of this system will be individuals with limited technical expertise who want to deblur their personal photographs. We already have a base model for the deblurring engine, which will be refined and integrated into the web application. For deployment, we will leverage free tier resources from cloud service providers to host the prototype.
